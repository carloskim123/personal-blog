Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a 14-year-old web developer currently navigating the exciting world of 9th grade in Maryland. When I'm not buried in textbooks, you'll likely find me strumming on my guitar, exploring both acoustic and electric sounds.

## Who Am I?

I'm not your typical high schooler; I'm the brains behind this blog site. It's my space to share my journey as a young web developer and offer insights into my life and experiences.

## What Powers This Blog?

Behind the scenes, I weave code to bring this blog to life. Here's a glimpse into the tech that fuels my creative outlet:

- **Languages:** Fluent in vanilla JavaScript, with a touch of TypeScript for type checking.
- **Interactivity:** Sprinkles of ReactJS for that dynamic touch.
- **Style:** TailwindCSS adds the finishing aesthetic strokes.
- **Content:** Markdown is my go-to for crafting engaging blog posts.
